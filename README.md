# PizzaScanner

It's a simple app which helps to determine if there is a pizza on photo or not. In this app i used CoreML technology which contains his own pre-trained model. This model helps us to identify pizza. So our model contains a lot of results with probabilities and we are using the highest one to identify our pizza.
